<p>Suppose that we have a periodic function \(f\text{,}\) and assume (for now) that \(f\) has a representation in terms of complex exponentials</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(t) = \sum_{n=-N}^N e^{2 \pi i n t}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Is it possible to compute the \(c_i\text{?}\) Since they are complex numbers, whatever we are going to do is going to involve dealing with that fact (which isn't really any more difficult that real calculus). There are many approaches to the next step, most involving serious algebra and calculus to arrive at the formula for computing \(c_i\text{.}\) We're going to move straight to the linear algebra perspective, which while more abstract is much more clear about why the formulas turn out the way that they do. First, we'll define perhaps the single most important vector space in mathematics.</p>
