<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One problem that we run into is that many functions cannot be expressed as combinations of the elementary functions that we learn in calculus (for example, \(f(x) = \int e^{x^2}\, dx\)), and these functions are frequently the solutions to differential equations like the one in the example above. We turn, as we did in calculus, to <dfn class="terminology">power series</dfn> representations of functions. Power series are one of the most important ideas developed in introductory calculus (though it is often the case that WHY you are learning about them isn't immediately obvious). We'll begin by recalled the definition of a power series, the question of when and where such a series converges, and some basic operations that we can perform</p>
