<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The most important quality of the Laplace transform is that it can be used on functions that are piecewise continuous. In physical situations, this correponds to forcing functions that change at points of time. For example, a continuously applied constant force could suddenly become a harmonic force modeled by a trig function at some time, and then at a later time, the force could disappear. Functions that change definitions, but which remain continuous in between those points of change are called <dfn class="terminology">piecewise continuous functions</dfn>.</p>
