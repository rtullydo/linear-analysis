<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">You might wonder why we would prefer to work with Legendre series rather than the Taylor series that are so easy to compute - first, notice that Taylor series only exist for <em class="emphasis">analytic</em> functions, where here we have Legendre series for functions that are merely continuously differentiable. Secondly, it turns out that working numerically with Taylor approximations is actually pretty terrible. The term used in numerical analysis is <dfn class="terminology">ill-conditioned</dfn>. Legendre expansions are significantly more stable in computations. In many cases, Legendre series also converge to the function being approximated much more quickly than Taylor series, which we can illustrate with the following example.</p>
