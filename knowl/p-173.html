<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One of the major themes of this section is that functions are secretly vectors. Even better, functions with some level of regularity are vectors in an inner product space, which means that we can use basic ideas from linear algebra to understand them (once we know which space they are in). The key idea in all of this is that the integral is really just an infinite sum indexed by the input \(x\text{,}\) and so the dot product is really just a finite dimensional version of an integral (in fact, there are areas of math where this is made explicit, as in probability theory).</p>
