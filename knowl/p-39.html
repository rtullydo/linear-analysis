<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now, for the second step, we need to find a <dfn class="terminology">particular solution</dfn> that we can feed into the differential equation so that \(\mathcal{F}(y_p) = f(x)\text{.}\) We learn several methods for this in first courses that consider differential equations, usually including the method of undetermined coefficients and the method of variation of parameters. In both cases, we're limited to either forcing functions nice enough that we can guess the form of the solution (in the case of undetermined coefficients) or functions that we can integrate (in the case of variation of parameters). However, in physical systems we often want to consider driving or forcing functions \(f(x)\) that represent physical conditions that don't have nice integrals: for example, switches that turn on and off, or impulses that are applied to the system instantaneously (such as a strike). While the methods above can be adapted to deal with these, it is easier to <dfn class="terminology">transform</dfn> the problem into a different mathematical setup that will simplify the process of dealing with these common physical situations.</p>
